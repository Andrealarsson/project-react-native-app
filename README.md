# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

In this week's project I have build my first mobile application with React Native!

I have used a movie API to fetch different information about each movie in a list of popular movies. The user can read more information about each movie when pressing. 
To be my first project in React Native I think it all went pretty smooth. I had some problem, in the beginning, viewing the app on my phone via Expo go. So I just looked on the browser which didn't look the same as on the phone and had to redo some styling.
